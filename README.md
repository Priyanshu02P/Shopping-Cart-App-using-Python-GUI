I have used Tkinter for GUI, and Pandas for data managment. 

Right now I have directly provided data as python dictionary(from const.py), 
May be in future I might use SQL based database for data management.

Application provides listing products based on categories and sorting them based on price.

Also we can apply discount using Code like 'WELCOME20'

And save bill in .csv file.
